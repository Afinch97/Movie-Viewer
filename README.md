# Milestone 3
This made the entire with a seperate flask backend and react frontend. I was not able to get the navbar to not show up in the sign up and log in pages. I could probably figure it out at some point but I don't want to turn it in a week late lol. Also couldn't re-render the comments page after deleting a comment.

I plan on fixing everything on my own.

The biggest issue so far has got to be the fething and objects. It was difficult for me to figure out at first. You can see how I got more comfortable with it going from the Movie.jsx where I had it to the point where I made a bunch of useStates for each list instead of taking the object and Comments.jsx where I got a bit more comfortable navigating around the Object as a whole.
All of the others issues are really small issues that took too long to realize.
Here's a list:
-Used double quotes instead of single for fetch and wasn't getting response took a very long time to realize that was the issue
-overall fetch is the greatest issue so far
-At one point it stopped rendering becasue root was in single quotes
-conflicting urls with the router
-I really can't return the numbers from query becasue it returns as a class instead of just the numbers that they are
    - So to fix this I had to convert the "object" to a string and then convert that into int. Literally (int(str(favs[i]))) fixed it


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
